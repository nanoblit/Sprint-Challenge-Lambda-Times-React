1. PropTypes are used for checking if props are present and their types. They are important because they help in avoiding bugs.

2. An example of a life-cycle event is componentDidUpdate. It runs after a prop or state has been changed. It's useful if we want something to happen every time the component updates.

3. HOC allow us to add functionality to components without rewriting it in every component. 

4. 1. Using plain CSS - it's simple, but not very flexible.
   2. Using a preprocessor, like Less - requires some setup and in the case of create-react-app, it requires ejecting. Writing styles is more flexible.
   3. Using a library like styled-components - requires installation of an npm package. It allows writing styles using full functionality of JavaScript.
